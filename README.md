## ðŸ“œ Usage
```lua
how to find args index? look below:
as you can see in image below, it warns argument/args of network.send but how do we know the index of it?, really simple.
Args are by default warned via 1-999 so meaning first arge is always the first in line for example "Character State Repeort - first arg |  17131191.111 - 2 Arg"
